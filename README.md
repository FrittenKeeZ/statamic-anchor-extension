## Statamic 2.11.3 changes

Statamic now has built in functionality for internal links!  
Version 1.2 contains a migration command which will handle everything you need for Statamic 2.11.3.  

```sh
php please anchor:migrate
```

I hope you enjoyed this small addon :)

## Installation

Download or clone the repository, then copy the folder `Anchor` to your site's `Addons` directory.

## Settings

Head to `/cp/addons/anchor/settings` and change what you feel like.

## Usage

Replace the internal links generated by the extension, by using the `anchor` modifier.
Passing `true` as argument will generate absolute URLs, otherwise relative are outputted.

```html
<div>{{ content | anchor:true }}</div>
```
